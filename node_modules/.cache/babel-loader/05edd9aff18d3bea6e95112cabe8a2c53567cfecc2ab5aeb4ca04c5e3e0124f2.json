Our IT department will further assess these problems and come up with a solution to allow staff to work from home. After piloting this policy for quarantine days only, we may consider permitting one day of work from home per week, however this will not be announced to staff until after the initial pilot is successful.\r\n                        <br/>This problem needs to be resolved by July, in order to permit working from home for the coming school year. The current severity of this problem is low, but it has a potential to impact security and productivity at a high level.</a>\r\n                    </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\nexport default My_ideas;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,oBAAoB;AAAC;AAC5B,SAASC,QAAQ,GAAE;EACf,oBACI;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAiB;IAAA,wBAC5B;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAA,wBACnB;QAAA,UAAI;MAAO;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eAChB;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAwB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eACnF;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAAsB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eACxD;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAwB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eACnF;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAAsB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eACxD;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAiC;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eAC5F;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAA+B;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eACjE;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAU;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eACrE;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACxC,eACN;MAAK,KAAK,EAAE;QAACC,UAAU,EAAC;MAAK,CAAE;MAAA,uBAC3B;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,KAAK,EAAE;UAACC,UAAU,EAAE;QAAM,CAAE;QAAA,wBAClD;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAA0B;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,8NAC3D;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,yaACL;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,sXACL;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,yVAAqV;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAC3V,eACP;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAAwC;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,6gCAA0/B;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAO,eAC9kC;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAAwC;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,6xBAAyxB;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAO,eAC72B;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAAwB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,gtBACrD;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,0aACL;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,+kBACL;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,wOAAoO;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAC1O;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IACL;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACJ;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACJ;AAEd;AAAC,KAhCQF,QAAQ;AAiCjB,eAAeA,QAAQ;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
