We need to build additional features to keep real estate investors staying with our platform for at least 4 months.</a></span>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\nexport default Problems;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,oBAAoB;AAAC;AAC5B,SAASC,QAAQ,GAAE;EACf,oBACI;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAiB;IAAA,wBAC5B;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAA,wBACnB;QAAA,UAAI;MAAO;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eAChB;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAI;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eAC/D;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAAE;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eACpC;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAwB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eACnF;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAAsB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eACxD;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAwB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eACnF;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAAsB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eACxD;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAiC;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eAC5F;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAA+B;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK,eACjE;QAAO,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,IAAI,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;QAAC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAU;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE,eACrE;QAAO,GAAG,EAAC,SAAS;QAAA,UAAC;MAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAQ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAK;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACxC,eACN;MAAK,KAAK,EAAE;QAACC,UAAU,EAAE;MAAK,CAAE;MAAA,uBAC5B;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAC,KAAK,EAAE;UAACC,UAAU,EAAE;QAAM,CAAE;QAAA,wBAClD;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,IAAI;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAAoB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,g4BAAk3B;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAO,eACh7B;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAAwC;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,6xBAAyxB;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAO,eAC72B;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAAwB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,gtBACrD;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,0aACL;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,+kBACL;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,wOAAoO;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAC1O,eACP;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAAwC;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,6gCAA0/B;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAO,eAC9kC;UAAA,uBAAM;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;YAAA,wBAAC;cAAA,UAAG;YAA0B;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAI;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAK,k0CAA8zC;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAO;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IACl4C;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACJ;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACJ;AAEd;AAAC,KA/BQF,QAAQ;AAgCjB,eAAeA,QAAQ;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
